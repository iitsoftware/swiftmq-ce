/**
 * <p>
 * Reliable Filetransfer over JMS.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class contains 2 factory methods to create a new Filetransfer object. One to send files, the other to receive files.
 * A JMS connection is passed as a parameter. A new dedicated JMS session is created from this JMS connection to perform the transfer so
 * files can be transferred by different Filetransfer objects in different threads. See the Filetransfer samples
 * which are contained in the SwiftMQ documentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Have a look at the <a href="http://www.swiftmq.com/products/router/swiftlets/sys_filecache/client/index.html">User's Guide</a>
